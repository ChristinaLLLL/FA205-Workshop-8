# FA205-Workshop-8

I struggled with this one and watched the tutorial 3 times.  I could not find files that worked well on the large free site. I started with random dog images but had trouble.  Then, I went back, looking at only files with data/text.  I tried a few different sites.  I could not get the word to continue to generate new words.  This was the hardest of all the tutorials, in my opinion.

Don't understand why the webpage doesn't load with the words, when it works in my sketch?
